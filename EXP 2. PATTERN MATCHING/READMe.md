# BCSL304 DATA  STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION LAB : EXP 2
# PATTERN MATCHING 

Develop a Program in C for the following operations on Strings. 
* a. Read a main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP)<br>
* b. Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in 
STR with REP if PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does not 
exist in STR<br>
Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use Built-in 
functions.

### OUTPUT 1 :

ENTER THE MAIN STRING (STR) : `He is a good boy`<br>
ENTER THE PATTERN TO BE MATCHED (PTR) : `good`<br>
ENTER THE STRING TO BE REPLACED (REP) : `bad`<br>
THE STRING BEFORE MATCH IS :
He is a good boy<br>
`Invalid length of replace string`<br><br>

### OUTPUT 2 :

ENTER THE MAIN STRING (STR) : `Computer ROM has been corrupted`<br>
ENTER THE PATTERN TO BE MATCHED (PTR) : `ROM`<br>
ENTER THE STRING TO BE REPLACED (REP) : `RAM`<br>
THE STRING BEFORE MATCH IS :
Computer ROM has been corrupted<br>
THE STRING AFTER PATTERN MATCH AND REPLACE IS : `Computer RAM has been corrupted`<br><br>
