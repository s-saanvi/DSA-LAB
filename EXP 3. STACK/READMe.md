# STACK OPERATIONS  

Develop a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on STACK of Integers 
(Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX) <br>
* a. Push an Element on to Stack<br>
* b. Pop an Element from Stack<br>
* c. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome<br>
* d. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack<br>
* e. Display the status of Stack<br>
* f. Exit<br>
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations<br>
